/*
create a program which prints out the days from monday to sunday
use a loop and variables to do that
for example:
for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++){
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
you can match the numbers with the name of the days
write this program first with if and else-if statements
then do it again with switch-statement
take the conclusion:
    - which method was faster?
    - which was shorter?
    - which one did you find easier?
